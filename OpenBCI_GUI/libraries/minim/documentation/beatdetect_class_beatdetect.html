    	The BeatDetect class allows you to analyze an audio stream for beats (rhythmic onsets). 
 <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/beatdetection">Beat
 Detection Algorithms</a> by Frederic Patin describes beats in the following
 way: <blockquote> The human listening system determines the rhythm of music
 by detecting a pseudo periodical succession of beats. The signal which is
 intercepted by the ear contains a certain energy, this energy is converted
 into an electrical signal which the brain interprets. Obviously, The more
 energy the sound transports, the louder the sound will seem. But a sound will
 be heard as a <em>beat</em> only if his energy is largely superior to the
 sound's energy history, that is to say if the brain detects a
 <em>brutal variation in sound energy</em>. Therefore if the ear intercepts
 a monotonous sound with sometimes big energy peaks it will detect beats,
 however, if you play a continuous loud sound you will not perceive any beats.
 Thus, the beats are big variations of sound energy. </blockquote> In fact,
 the two algorithms in this class are based on two algorithms described in
 that paper.
 <p>
 To use this class, inside of <code>draw()</code> you must first call
 <code>detect()</code>, passing the <code>AudioBuffer</code> you want to
 analyze. You may then use the <code>isXXX</code> functions to find out what
 beats have occurred in that frame. For example, you might use
 <code>isKick()</code> to cause a circle to pulse.
 <p>
 BeatDetect has two modes: sound energy tracking and frequency energy
 tracking. In sound energy mode, the level of the buffer, as returned by
 <code>level()</code>, is used as the instant energy in each frame. Beats,
 then, are spikes in this value, relative to the previous one second of sound.
 In frequency energy mode, the same process is used but instead of tracking
 the level of the buffer, an FFT is used to obtain a spectrum, which is then
 divided into average bands using <code>logAverages()</code>, and each of
 these bands is tracked individually. The result is that it is possible to
 track sounds that occur in different parts of the frequency spectrum
 independently (like the kick drum and snare drum).
 <p>
 In sound energy mode you use <code>isOnset()</code> to query the algorithm
 and in frequency energy mode you use <code>isOnset(int i)</code>,
 <code>isKick()</code>, <code>isSnare()</code>, and
 <code>isRange()</code> to query particular frequnecy bands or ranges of
 frequency bands. It should be noted that <code>isKick()</code>,
 <code>isSnare()</code>, and <code>isHat()</code> merely call
 <code>isRange()</code> with values determined by testing the algorithm
 against music with a heavy beat and they may not be appropriate for all kinds
 of music. If you find they are performing poorly with your music, you should
 use <code>isRange()</code> directly to locate the bands that provide the
 most meaningful information for you.
