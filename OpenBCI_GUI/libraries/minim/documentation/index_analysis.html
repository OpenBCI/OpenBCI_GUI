	<strong>Fast Fourier Transform</strong>
	<p>
	A Fourier Transform is an algorithm that transforms a signal in the time
 	domain, such as a sample buffer, into a signal in the frequency domain, often
 	called the spectrum. The spectrum does not represent individual frequencies,
 	but actually represents frequency bands centered on particular frequencies.
 	The center frequency of each band is usually expressed as a fraction of the
 	sampling rate of the time domain signal and is equal to the index of the
	frequency band divided by the total number of bands. The total number of
 	frequency bands is usually equal to the length of the time domain signal, but
	access is only provided to frequency bands with indices less than half the
 	length, because they correspond to frequencies below the <a
 	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>.
 	In other words, given a signal of length <code>N</code>, there will be
 	<code>N/2</code> frequency bands in the spectrum.
 	<p>
 	<strong>Beat (or Onset) Detection</strong>
 	<p>
 	The BeatDetect class allows you to analyze an audio stream for beats (rhythmic onsets). 
 	<a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/beatdetection">Beat
 	Detection Algorithms</a> by Frederic Patin describes beats in the following
 	way: 
 	
 	<blockquote> 
 	The human listening system determines the rhythm of music
 	by detecting a pseudo periodical succession of beats. The signal which is
 	intercepted by the ear contains a certain energy, this energy is converted
 	into an electrical signal which the brain interprets. Obviously, The more
 	energy the sound transports, the louder the sound will seem. But a sound will
 	be heard as a <em>beat</em> only if his energy is largely superior to the
 	sound's energy history, that is to say if the brain detects a
 	<em>brutal variation in sound energy</em>. Therefore if the ear intercepts
 	a monotonous sound with sometimes big energy peaks it will detect beats,
 	however, if you play a continuous loud sound you will not perceive any beats.
 	Thus, the beats are big variations of sound energy. 
 	</blockquote> 
 	In fact, the two algorithms in this class are based on two algorithms described in
 	that paper.
 	<p>
 	BeatDetect has two modes: sound energy tracking and frequency energy
 	tracking. In sound energy mode, the level of the buffer, as returned by
 	<code>level()</code>, is used as the instant energy in each frame. Beats,
 	then, are spikes in this value, relative to the previous one second of sound.
 	In frequency energy mode, the same process is used but instead of tracking
 	the level of the buffer, an FFT is used to obtain a spectrum, which is then
 	divided into average bands using <code>logAverages()</code>, and each of
 	these bands is tracked individually. The result is that it is possible to
 	track sounds that occur in different parts of the frequency spectrum
 	independently (like the kick drum and snare drum).
 	<p>
 	In sound energy mode you use <code>isOnset()</code> to query the algorithm
 	and in frequency energy mode you use <code>isOnset(int i)</code>,
 	<code>isKick()</code>, <code>isSnare()</code>, and
 	<code>isRange()</code> to query particular frequnecy bands or ranges of
 	frequency bands. It should be noted that <code>isKick()</code>,
 	<code>isSnare()</code>, and <code>isHat()</code> merely call
 	<code>isRange()</code> with values determined by testing the algorithm
 	against music with a heavy beat and they may not be appropriate for all kinds
 	of music. If you find they are performing poorly with your music, you should
	use <code>isRange()</code> directly to locate the bands that provide the
 	most meaningful information for you.</td>
