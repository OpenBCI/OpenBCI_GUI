notes_Arduino

Modified from Tom Igoe's code.
It should be able to turn on an LED by focus on pin 2.
To replicate this example, you will need an Arduino Uno (101 is ok as well) and set up an LED output there, then upload this code to your Arduino.
Also you need to set the serial_output_portName in OpenBCI.pde as your Arduino's serial port name, and also set serial_output_baud to be 9600 (you can use other baud rate but need to ensure serial_output_baud is the same as the number in Serial.begin() in the Arduino file).
Once you're prepared, you can run the openBCI GUI and turn on Serial in Focus Widget.

Enjoy then :)
