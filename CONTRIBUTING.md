## How can I contribute?

This is currently a small, humble project so our contribution process is rather casual. If there's a feature you'd be interested in building, go ahead! Let us know on the [OpenBCI Forum](https://openbci.com/forum/) or [open an issue](../../issues) so others can follow along and we'll support you as much as we can. When you're finished submit a pull request to the master branch referencing the specific issue you addressed.

If you find a bug, or have a suggestion on how to improve the project, please fill out a [Github issue](../../issues).

### Steps to Contribute

1. Fork it!
2. Branch off of `development`: `git checkout development`
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Make changes
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. Submit a pull request. Make sure it is based off of the `development` branch when submitting! :D
