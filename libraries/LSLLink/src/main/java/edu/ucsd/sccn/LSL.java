/**
 * Java API for the lab streaming layer.
 *
 * The lab streaming layer provides a set of functions to make instrument data accessible
 * in real time within a lab network. From there, streams can be picked up by recording programs,
 * viewing programs or custom experiment applications that access data streams in real time.
 *
 * The API covers two areas:
 * - The "push API" allows to create stream outlets and to push data (regular or irregular measurement
 *   time series, event data, coded audio/video frames, etc.) into them.
 * - The "pull API" allows to create stream inlets and read time-synched experiment data from them
 *   (for recording, viewing or experiment control).
